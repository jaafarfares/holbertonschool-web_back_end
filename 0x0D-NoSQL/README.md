# 0x0D. NoSQL

#### MongoDB is a popular NoSQL (non-relational) database management system that is designed for scalability, flexibility, and performance. It uses a document-oriented data model, which means that data is stored in the form of JSON-like documents, making it a natural fit for modern web and mobile applications.

MongoDB is a highly flexible database that allows for dynamic schema design, making it easy to modify and scale data structures as needed. It also provides a powerful set of features such as automatic sharding, high availability, and horizontal scaling, which makes it an ideal choice for building applications that require high performance and availability.

Some of the key advantages of MongoDB include its ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data, its support for multiple data formats and data models, and its ability to scale horizontally across multiple nodes. Additionally, MongoDB has a vibrant community of developers and a large ecosystem of third-party tools and plugins that make it easy to integrate with other technologies and build complex applications.

Overall, MongoDB is a powerful and flexible NoSQL database that is well-suited for a wide range of applications and use cases, from small-scale projects to large-scale enterprise applications.

in this project we will test and work with all those futures
