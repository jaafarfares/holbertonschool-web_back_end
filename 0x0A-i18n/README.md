This project is focused on localizing a Flask app in multiple languages. The project consists of multiple tasks, starting with setting up a basic Flask app and progressing to localizing timestamps. The tasks include learning how to parametrize Flask templates to display different languages, infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user settings, or request headers, and localize timestamps. The project also includes installing and using Flask-Babel and pytz, and learning how to create a Config class that has a LANGUAGES class attribute equal to ["en", "fr"].
