# 0x0B. Redis basic




#### Redis is an open-source, in-memory, data structure store that is used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis supports various data structures, including strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets, and provides several operations for each data type. Redis is often used as a cache because it stores data in-memory, allowing for fast access and retrieval. Additionally, Redis provides persistence options that can be configured to store data on disk or in memory, making it suitable for use cases that require high performance and durability. Redis also provides support for replication, sharding, and transactions, making it a highly scalable and flexible solution. Redis can be accessed using various programming languages and provides client libraries for several popular languages, including Python, Java, and Ruby.
