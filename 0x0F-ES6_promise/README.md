# 0x0F. ES6 Promises



In this JavaScript project, we will delve into the world of Promises, which is a fundamental method used frequently in JavaScript programming. We will explore the concepts of Promises, including how to use the then, resolve, and catch methods, as well as how to use every method of the Promise object. Additionally, we will learn about throw/try statements and how to handle errors effectively when working with Promises.

We will also explore the powerful async and await operators, which provide an intuitive and concise way to work with Promises in JavaScript. We will examine the syntax and usage of async functions, which allow us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style, making it easier to read and maintain.

By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of how to use Promises, async and await operators in JavaScript, and how they can be leveraged to write more efficient, scalable, and maintainable code.
