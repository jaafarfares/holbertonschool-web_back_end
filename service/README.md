# 0x08. User authentication service


## Description 

In this project, we will create a user authentication service using Flask and SQLAlchemy. To help us better understand this mechanism, we will walk through each step by doing. The first step is to create an API using Flask and define API routes for user authentication. We will also implement a User model in SQLAlchemy to represent the users in the database. The project will involve adding, finding, and updating users in the database by implementing relevant methods.

To handle user authentication, we will implement methods to get and set cookies, retrieve form data, and return various HTTP status codes. Finally, to ensure secure password storage, we will implement a method to hash user passwords using bcrypt.hashpw. By completing this project, we will gain a better understanding of how to declare API routes in a Flask app, how to get and set cookies, how to retrieve request form data, and how to return various HTTP status codes.
