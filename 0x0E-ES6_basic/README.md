# 0x0E. ES6 Basics

##### In this project, we will learn about ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, which brought several important features to the JavaScript language that significantly improved its capabilities and made it easier to write complex applications. Some of the most important features introduced in ES6 include arrow functions, classes, let and const declarations, template literals, destructuring assignments, and promises. With these features, developers can write more concise, maintainable, and scalable code that follows modern JavaScript practices.



### Learning Objectives

* What ES6 is
* New features introduced in ES6
* The difference between a constant and a variable
* Block-scoped variables
* Arrow functions and function parameters default to them
* Rest and spread function parameters
* String templating in ES6
* Object creation and their properties in ES6
* Iterators and for-of loops
